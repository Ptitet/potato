# ðŸ¥” Potato

Potato is a little utility script to boost yout potato PC / laptop.

This is to be taken as a joke of course, the main purpose of this script is to display funny fake logs of installing weird features that are totally useless or impossible.

# Install

Simply run the install script:

```sh
> sudo ./install
```

This will copy potato in `/usr/local/bin/`, which should be in your PATH. If not, simply run the following:

```sh

```

After that, potato is ready to use ! You can now head over the [how to use](#how-to-use) section.

```sh
> sudo ./install -r 
```
